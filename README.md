# Retro Snake Game

Welcome to the Retro Snake Game repository! This is a classic snake game in a retro style, recreated in Javascript.
## About the Game

Retro Snake Game is a version inspired by classic arcade games, where you control a snake in search of food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. The challenge is to increase the snake's size by eating food without allowing it to collide with itself or the edges of the game field.
## How to Play

To play, simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction and try to accumulate as many points as possible!
